# Verifiable data

Verifiable data plays a crucial role in the emerging field of self-sovereign identity and verifiable credentials. In this context, verifiable data refers to data anyone can verify without a centralized authority or intermediary.

Self-sovereign identity (SSI) is a concept that empowers individuals to take control of their own digital identities, which includes managing their data and controlling with whom it's shared. Verifiable credentials are a crucial component of SSI, as they allow individuals to share specific data about themselves (such as their name, date of birth, or educational qualifications) with others in a secure and trustworthy way.

Creating verifiable credentials uses blockchain technology, cryptography, and standardized data formats. They consist of claims describing a particular aspect of an individual's identity or qualifications, along with cryptographic proofs that allow verification of the claims. These proofs get created using public key cryptography, which enables anyone to verify that the data in the credential hasn't been tampered with or altered.

Verifiable data in SSI and verifiable credentials have several significant benefits.

First, it gives individuals greater control over their data and how it's shared. It can help reduce the risk of identity theft and fraud and make it easier for individuals to manage their identities across multiple contexts and services.

Second, verifiable data provides higher trust and security in online interactions. By allowing anyone to verify the authenticity of data, it's possible to establish trust and confidence in online transactions without needing a centralized authority or intermediary. As a result, it has important implications for various industries, from healthcare and finance to education and e-commerce.

Verifiable data is critical to the emerging field of digital identity. Verifiable data will change how we manage and share our identities online by enabling individuals to take control of their data and providing a higher level of trust and security in online interactions.
