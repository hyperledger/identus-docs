# Trust

Trust is hard. It becomes infinitely more challenging when we introduce strangers on the internet into the mix. We expect to have some certainty or confidence with claims made about an entity. As an example, a stranger claims they are a doctor. How do you know? Is it because they are wearing scrubs with a white coat? Is it the paper hanging on the wall? Could that document be fake? What makes us comfortable with a doctor claiming they are a doctor? In today's world, typically, it's an accumulation of things, referrals, an office, the equipment in the office, staff, attire, license on the wall, etc.

These things give us comfort and a sense that we are dealing with an entity claiming to be a doctor. Sure, it could be a scam, but there's a reasonable expectation this entity is a doctor. None of this exists in the digital world today, but with digital identity, it's necessary because it gives us comfort and some level of certainty in the digital world.

## Trust/Governance Framework

Trust is hard in the digital world, and this is where the role of a Trust/Governance Framework becomes useful. Before we begin, the terms Trust/Governance in this context are the same. Some prefer the word trust because governance implies government, which isn't necessarily the case.

A Trust/Governance Framework does govern an ecosystem. An example in practice today is a medical board. In the United States, states delegate responsibility to various authorities. For example, a state medical board inherits its authority from the state, typically via law or regulation. In a digital world, the state could issue the medical board a verifiable credential that is presentable and verifiable.

This board consists of legal experts and practicing attorney's this board agrees collectively to determine what qualifies a person to be a lawyer in that state. This board issues a law license or a verifiable credential to the attorney. 

The attorney can then present that document or verifiable credential to clients, law firms, etc., for verification.

## Trust registry

A trust registry exists because a Trust/Governance Framework creates and manages it. Its sole purpose is to make a transparent trail of trusted issuers and, in some cases, verifiers. Trust registries not only establish a mechanism to verify issuers and their authority, but it also keeps blockchain transactions to a minimum, keeping costs down.

> **Note:** Repositories are the best candidate for distributing a single source of truth across many sources and maintaining transparency. Another benefit of the repository is that the Trust/Governance Framework could have its governing rules and processes published, maintain a versioning history, and efficiently distribute updates.

The Atala PRISM Pioneer Program has a functioning trust framework that is available [here](https://github.com/AtalaPRISMTribe/PPPGF) as an example.
