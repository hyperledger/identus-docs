# Digital wallets

There is some ambiguity about what a digital wallet is, but there is an overarching theme that seems to have a universal agreement:
A digital wallet consists of software (optionally hardware) that enables the wallet's controller to generate, store, manage, and protect cryptographic keys, secrets, and other sensitive private data as verifiable credentials.

What is defined as other sensitive private data is as varied as what people keep in their physical wallets or purses, such as:
* DIDs
* Verifiable credentials
    * Digital copies of physical documents (i.e., PDF of a passport)
    * Business cards
    * Resumes, CVs
    * Usernames and passwords (i.e., password manager)
* Digital wallets can store cryptocurrencies and digital tokens, and there is a logical path to include digital identity.

A digital agent is a software that allows a user to take actions, communication, store info, and track usage of the wallet. The agent works with the wallet to ensure full functionality and a seamless user experience. To learn more about how the PRISM Agent works, refer to the PRISM Agent section.
