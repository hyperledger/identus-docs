# Getting Started

Atala PRISM is a decentralized identity platform. It is a layer-2 blockchain solution that leverages the Cardano blockchain as a verifiable data registry (VDR). PRISM is rooted in the principles of self-sovereign identity (SSI). PRISM empowers users to own and control their identity, and personal information, which they can share securely, using asymmetric cryptography, and privately opting with whom to share their data.

The documentation herein will explain the following:

* The concepts of SSI
* How PRISM works
* Setting up a PRISM environment
* Begin developing with PRISM

For a complete learning experience, including Q&A, workshops, and networking, we do have training available via the Atala PRISM Pioneer Program, which covers the following:

* Foundations of Self-Sovereign Identity
* Building with Atala PRISM
* Human-centric Design
