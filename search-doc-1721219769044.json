They allow specifying the minimum and maximum allowed values for numeric attributes within a credential.  Option to set Minimum valueOption to set Maximum value  Format​  The &quot;format&quot; rule ensures that the attribute values representing integers are within the expected bit size range. This helps maintain data integrity and enables consistent interpretation and handling of integer values in the context of the credential.

The other party then uses their SSI wallet to respond to the challenge by signing the nonce and sending it back to the submission endpoint specified in the challenge.  Let's go through the whole process in more detail.  Application creates a new authentication challenge. The challenge contains a nonce, expiration time, and submission endpoint. It also includes a type field used as a protocol identifier for wallets to understand how to process the message.  An example of an authentication challenge state:  { &quot;self&quot;: &quot;https://demo.atalaprism.io/did-authentication/challenges/challenge-id-1234&quot;, &quot;kind&quot;: &quot;AuthenticationChallengeState&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: &quot;challenge-id-1234&quot;, &quot;challenge&quot;: { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;https://atalaprism.io/authentication-challenge&quot;, &quot;submissionEndpoint&quot;: &quot;https://demo.atalaprism.io:8085/did-authentication/challenge-submissions/request-id-1234&quot;, &quot;nonce&quot;: &quot;authenticate-NzIxZTZmNjQtOGY0Ni00ODQ4LWFhYjAtZGYzNDJmYzNlMjM2&quot;, &quot;from&quot;: &quot;Application ABC&quot;, &quot;expireAt&quot;: &quot;2021-10-31T09:22:23Z&quot; }, &quot;did&quot;: null, &quot;state&quot;: &quot;pending&quot;, &quot;createdAt&quot;: &quot;2023-02-24T19:13:23Z&quot;, &quot;updatedAt&quot;: &quot;2023-02-24T19:13:23Z&quot; }   It contains a challenge field and other metadata which makes it possible to track the challenge over time.  Note: Only the challenge field should be encoded and sent to the other side!  It is possible to add the optional from field too. It is a human-readable label that represents the party requesting authentication. Wallets could use this label later to display information to users about who is sending requests.  The initial state is pending, and did field is null.  Next, the challenge object is encoded, typically as a QR code or deep link, depending on the use case. The encoded challenge is then presented or sent to the other party.  Now, the receiving party uses their wallet to decode and process the received authentication challenge. In this case, the type field gets checked for valuehttps://atalaprism.io/authentication-challenge. The wallet then should present a prompt to the user to accept or reject the request, showing the optionalfrom label. If the user accepts the request, the next step is to instruct the wallet which DID to use to respond to the challenge. The authentication key from the selected DID signs the nonce field and sends the signature, and the used DID to the submission endpoint specified in the challenge.  Upon receiving the response, the Authenticate service verifies the signature and updates the challenge state accordingly. In the case of an invalid signature, the state changes to error. In the case of a valid signature, the state is set tosuccess and the did field gets populated with the DID used to sign the response.  During the process, an application can query the state of the sent authentication challenge to check the response status and if it's valid. As mentioned, the terminal state is either error or success. Once the challenge response is received, the application can act upon it, depending on the business logic. For example, creating a login session for the user based on JWT.  Note: Authenticate service only checks if the signature is valid, based on the DID used to sign the response. Checking if the given DID is known to the application is the application's responsibility.

It functions as a verifiable data registry, providing a secure and reliable way to store and manage data. PRISM Node's primary purpose is to provide a secure and trustworthy platform for storing and managing data on the distributed ledger. By leveraging the blockchain's security and decentralization, the PRISM Node stores and retrieves data in a secure and immutable manner. All operations are independently verified and authenticated using cryptographic signatures and other security measures, so all data is accurate and trustworthy. The PRISM Node runs alongside a blockchain. It keeps the internal state synchronized with the underlying blockchain and indexed for efficient lookup operations. Furthermore, it implements did:prism method in an efficient and scalable way by publishing transactions to the distributed ledger. These transactions support the PRISM Node's protocol and perform the creation, update, resolution, and deactivation of decentralized identifiers (DIDs). The PRISM Node generates a transaction with information about the DID operation and verifies and validates the DID operation before publishing it to the blockchain.

It functions as a verifiable data registry, providing a secure and reliable way to store and manage data. PRISM Node's primary purpose is to provide a secure and trustworthy platform for storing and managing data on the Distributed Ledger. By leveraging the blockchain's security and decentralization, the PRISM Node stores and retrieves data in a secure and immutable manner. All operations are independently verified and authenticated using cryptographic signatures and other security measures, so all data is accurate and trustworthy. The PRISM Node runs alongside a blockchain. It keeps the internal state synchronized with the underlying blockchain and indexed for efficient lookup operations. Furthermore, it implements did:prism method in an efficient and scalable way by publishing transactions to the Distributed Ledger. These transactions support the PRISM Node's protocol and perform the creation, update, resolution, and deactivation of decentralized identifiers (DIDs). The PRISM Node generates a transaction with information about the DID operation and verifies and validates the DID operation before publishing it to the blockchain.

To run it on Cardano, you must set the NODE_LEDGER environment variable to cardano. If you do this, Node will utilize the Cardano wallet backend and DB-sync to query for blocks and submit transactions. It is crucial to have the Cardano wallet backend and DB-sync running before running the Node with NODE_LEDGER set to cardano.  Most up-to-date instructions on how to run the Cardano wallet backend and DB-sync are available in their respective repositories:  Cardano wallet backendDB-sync  Once you have these services up and running, specify their respective URLs in the environment variables of the Node:  Cardano wallet backend NODE_CARDANO_WALLET_API_HOST for wallet server hostNODE_CARDANO_WALLET_API_PORT for wallet server portNODE_CARDANO_WALLET_ROUTING_HEADER_NAME for wallet routing header name DB-sync NODE_CARDANO_DB_SYNC_HOST for DB-sync host and port in a format host:portNODE_CARDANO_DB_SYNC_DATABASE the databse name in DB-sync postgres databaseNODE_CARDANO_DB_SYNC_USERNAME DB-sync Database usernameNODE_CARDANO_DB_SYNC_PASSWORD DB-sync Database password  When running the Node with Cardano ledger, you must specify which network to use, either mainnet or testnet, using the NODE_CARDANO_NETWORK environment variable. While this environment variable is essential for the correct operation of the Node, it does not define the usable network. As mentioned earlier, the interface communicates with the Cardano node; subsequently, the network is DB-sync and Cardano wallet backend. Therefore, when configuring those services, you must specify the network used in their respective configurations. It is possible to run DB-sync on testnet, and Cardano wallet backend on mainnet, and select either one via NODE_CARDANO_NETWORK. The Node won't report any errors, but this configuration would be incorrect and won't work correctly. You are responsible for syncing these three components. If you intend to use the testnet, set NODE_CARDANO_NETWORK to the testnet, but also run Cardano wallet backend connected to the testnet and start DB-sync to sync from the Node that is also running on the testnet as well. The same goes with mainnet.  Apart from that, you must also provide the Wallet ID and its spending password as environment variables as well:  NODE_CARDANO_WALLET_ID - The wallet ID must be in hex-encoded format, and the wallet must belong to the network you are running the Node on, which can be either testnet or mainnetNODE_CARDANO_WALLET_PASSPHRAS - Spending password or wallet above  The Node utilizes Cardano as a decentralized open database, and its implementation is similar to the DIF Sidetree Protocol. In short, the Node stores all relevant information in a Cardano transaction metadata and sends 1 ADA (minimum allowed amount) to another address, which you must provide via the NODE_CARDANO_PAYMENT_ADDRESS environment variable, which will store arbitrary information on the blockchain. In most cases, you don't need to specify a particular address for sending transactions as long as the transaction gets recorded. In this case, you should set NODE_CARDANO_PAYMENT_ADDRESS to the same address you are sending transactions from, NODE_CARDANO_WALLET_ID. In this configuration, you are not spending any ADA other than the transaction fee for every transaction. Suppose your wallet does not have enough ADA to cover the transaction fee (plus 1 ADA to send to yourself). In that case, the transaction won't get recorded, and your operation, which includes any DID-related action, won't be submitted.  The last component is the database that the Node uses internally to index Identus cloud agent related Cardano transactions and maintain the state of DID documents. It is a simple PostgreSQL version 13 database, and you can use the Docker image postgres:13 to run it.  When running the Node, you must specify the host, database name, username, and password of this database via environment variables.  NODE_PSQL_HOST - host with a port, in a format host:portNODE_PSQL_DATABASE - database nameNODE_PSQL_USERNAME - usernameNODE_PSQL_PASSWORD - password  The Node gRPC server has three dependencies: Node DB, Cardano wallet, and DB-sync. You need to run these three services before starting the Node.  Node DB is a simple PostgreSQL database.  Cardano wallet is an application that communicates with the Cardano network; it functions as a server that you can start and connect to either the mainnet or testnet. You must provide the Node runnable's host and port as environment variables.  DB-sync is an application responsible for syncing the Cardano blockchain with a PostgreSQL database. It would help if you used it to sync with either the mainnet or testnet and must provide the database host with port, database name, and credentials as environment variables to the Node runnable.

The other party then uses their wallet to scan/receive the DID request and send back the existing or new DID.  Let's go through the whole process in more detail.  The inviting party creates a so-called &quot;DID request.&quot; An example of a request state:  { &quot;self&quot;: &quot;https://demo.atalaprism.io/did-requests/did-request-1234&quot;, &quot;kind&quot;: &quot;DidRequestState&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: &quot;did-request-1234&quot;, &quot;didRequest&quot;: { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;https://atalaprism.io/did-request&quot;, &quot;onboardEndpoint&quot;: &quot;https://demo.atalaprism.io:8085/request-id-1234&quot;, &quot;from&quot;: &quot;Application ABC&quot; }, &quot;did&quot;: null, &quot;state&quot;: &quot;pending&quot;, &quot;createdAt&quot;: &quot;2023-02-24T10:22:23Z&quot;, &quot;updatedAt&quot;: &quot;2023-02-24T10:22:23Z&quot; }   It contains the didRequest field and other metadata that makes tracking the requesting possible.  Note: Only the didRequest field should be encoded and sent to the other side!  The optional from field could be added too. It is a human-readable label that represents the inviting party. Wallets could use this label later to display information to users about who is sending request.  The initial state is pending, and did field is null.  Next, the didRequest object is encoded depending on the use case, typically as a QR code or deep link. The encoded request gets sent to the other party via an appropriate channel: email, chat message, or presenting directly in a web app.  Now, the receiving party uses their wallet to decode and process the received DID request. The type of message is identifiable by the type field. In the case of DID request, it is https://atalaprism.io/did-request. The wallet then should present a prompt to the user to accept or reject the request, showing optionallyfrom label. If the user accepts the request, the wallet creates a new relationship and sends its DID back to the onboardEndpoint specified in the DID request.  During the process, the inviting party can query the sent DID request's state to check the response status. The terminal state is either error orsuccess with received DID in did field. Once the DID is received, depending on the business logic, the application can act upon it, for example, associate it with a user ID in the main application state.  Note: DID request is for one-time use only. The request is invalidated if the response is received and is not reusable.  Note: Currently, if a DID is under the other party's control, there is no mechanism to verify.. See Authenticate API if such a feature is required.

The encryption algorithm, ECDH-ES+A256KW, combined with AES-256-CBC and HMAC SHA-512, ensures that the data remains confidential and tamper-proof.

This Quick Start Guide explains the fundamental concepts to get up and running with Hyperledger Identus. This guide will familiarize you with the general concepts and how to create decentralized identifiers (DIDs), issue credentials, make connections, and verify credentials with verifiable presentations. Refer to the Concepts and Components sections for a more in-depth explanation.  The trust triangle is the most basic process for conveying trust in the digital world. There are three roles in an SSI ecosystem: Holders, Issuers, and Verifiers.    Holders can be any entity, such as individuals, organizations, and digital or physical things. They will hold verifiable credentials (VCs) and use a verifiable presentation to share their VCs.  Issuers can also be any entity that makes claims about an entity. These claims are attestations, or evidence of something, about the Holder. As an example, an insurance company would provide proof of valid insurance.  Verifiers are the relying party in the triangle. They will request information from the Holder, such as proof of insurance, and the Holder will use a verifiable presentation to share the appropriate VCs with the Verifier. The Holder's digital signature, the issuer DID get verified, and the contents therein to ensure nothing has been tampered with.

For flexibility in defining custom policy and permission models, administrators can manually create these UMA resources (resource, policy, permission) directly on Keycloak using a set of UMA endpoints called Protection API (see Keycloak Protection API). However, using Protection API to manage permissions is out of the scope of this tutorial.  Once the registration is successful, the tenant can obtain an ID token from Keycloak using any available OIDC flow, such as the direct access grants (username &amp; password). This ID token typically contains user claims such as username and subject ID.

By default, the agent uses this backend but the option is configurable. To utilize this backend, set the SECRET_STORAGE_BACKEND variable to vault.  Authentication and Authorization  The agent expects to read and write secrets to the path /secret/*, so ensure the appropriate permissions are provisioned.  Example Vault policy  path &quot;secret/*&quot; { capabilities = [&quot;create&quot;, &quot;read&quot;, &quot;update&quot;, &quot;patch&quot;, &quot;delete&quot;, &quot;list&quot;] }   HashiCorp Vault provides multiple authentication methods. One of the simplest methods is token authentication. To authenticate using the token, set the environment variable VAULT_TOKEN. The agent prefers token authentication if provided with multiple authentication methods.  Another method is AppRole authentication which is suitable for automatic workflows. To use AppRole authentication, set the environment variable VAULT_APPROLE_ROLE_ID and VAULT_APPROLE_SECRET_ID.  Storage Backend  HashiCorp Vault supports multiple backends for storage, such as filesystem, Etcd, PostgreSQL, or Integrated Storage (Raft). Each backend has different properties, which have implications for how secrets can be stored. The agent logically stores secrets in the following hierarchies.  # Wallet seed /secret/&lt;wallet-id&gt;/seed # Peer DID keys /secret/&lt;wallet-id&gt;/dids/peer/&lt;peer-did&gt;/keys/&lt;key-id&gt; # Generic secrets /secret/&lt;wallet-id&gt;/generic-secrets/&lt;specific-path&gt;   Each storage backend has certain limitations, such as size, number of sub-paths, or path length. Some backends can support path lengths of up to 32,768 characters, while others only allow a few hundred characters. In some cases, the storage backends might not support the above logical convention due to excessively long paths.  To address this issue, the agent supports path shortening. This feature can be toggled by setting the environment variable VAULT_USE_SEMANTIC_PATH=false. When it is disabled, the unbounded portion of the path will be replaced by a SHA-256 digest of the original relative path. Additionally, the original path will be stored in the secret metadata.

However, this option must be explicitly chosen and will replace Vault. By opting for Postgres, there is no need for an additional service like Vault, which simplifies the process of setting up a local development instance. It utilizes the same database instance as the agent itself. To enable this option, set the SECRET_STORAGE_BACKEND to postgres, and it will utilize the same database configuration as the agent's database. It is important to note that while this option facilitates an easier development experience, it does not provide a secure method of storing secrets. The data is not encrypted, making it unsuitable for production use.

One of the authorization mechanism for the Cloud Agent's webhook notifications is the bearer token. If configured, the token will be included in the Authorization header of the HTTP request sent by the agent to the webhook endpoint. You can configure this bearer token by setting the value of theGLOBAL_WEBHOOK_API_KEY or DEFAULT_WALLET_WEBHOOK_API_KEY environment variable.
