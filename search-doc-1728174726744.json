The decision was made by team consensus during the first AOH meeting to follow &quot;OpenAPI specification first&quot; approach and generate stubs, server side and client side code based on OAS. Following this strategy we currently have 4-5 OAS files (Castor, Pollux, Mercury, Configuration).  The following tool was selected for code generation: OpenAPI Tools  Instead of using the yaml file as OpenAPI specification and openapi-generator for server and client stub generation - this ADR proposes to use Tapir Scala library as DSL for OpenAPI specification, interpret the endpoint defitions as Scala server and client stub, generate the yaml file, and use openapi-generator for client stubs.  Technology stack that is going to be used in the Identus platform backend: Scala 3 + ZIO ecosystem  Akka framework after version 2.6.x cannot be used because Lightbend changed the license type to BSL 1.1.  Looks like Akka 2.6.x still can be used according to License FQA  Currently, we have a code generation for Akka that is wrapped up into ZIO. Code generation mustache templates for ZIO-http are not available in OpenAPI tools.  Mustache templates and code generation doesn't work out of the box, so the original templates where copied to the project and fixed by @Shota and @Pat. Current templates and generator contains constraints that were reported by @Pat and @Shota, this requires engineering time to adopt the OAS for a code generation. @Ben says that we can live with these constraints  Generally, OAS files are written by the engineers with different experience and different view on formatting, schemas, normalization, datatype. For instance, in current templates don't have  a consistent way for paginating the entitiesstandard Responses for 4xx and 5xx errorsnormalized data types (we use anyOf, allOf)query parameters convention for filtering the entitiessome data types are duplicated in both Castor and Pollux OAS  As OAS specification evolves it's getting harder to manage it because of the size of the file. To mitigate this issue @Pat proposed to use well-known tools: &quot;Knowing that there are tools like dhall or CUE that allow us to write large configuration in yaml (or json) in a typesafe / reuseable way, I'm not hesitant to go contract-first.&quot;(c)  Quality and formatting of autogenerated code depend on the template (not all templates are good enough).

Backend services: Identus Cloud Agent, Identus Mediator, and PRISM Node use PostgreSQL.  Doobie library is currently used in Scala code to communicate with Postgresql. Quotes from the website  Doobie is a pure functional JDBC layer for Scala and Cats. It is not an ORM, nor is it a relational algebra; it simply provides a functional way to construct programs (and higher-level libraries) that use JDBC doobie is a Typelevel project. This means we embrace pure, typeful, functional programming, and provide a safe and friendly environment for teaching, learning, and contributing as described in the Scala Code of Conduct.   Doobie is a good choice for DAL, and this ADR is about something other than replacing it.  Writing the SQL statement and mapping the row to the case class is a boilerplate and error-prone activity that the Quill library can optimize.  Writing the code for mapping a table row to a case class and writing the low-level SQL statement is an error-prone and boilerplate thing  Using the Quill library on top of Doobie can optimize and improve these things.Quote from the website:  Quill provides a Quoted Domain Specific Language (QDSL) to express queries in Scala and execute them in a target language. The library’s core is designed to support multiple target languages, currently featuring specializations for Structured Query Language (SQL) and Cassandra Query Language (CQL). 1. Boilerplate-free mapping: The database schema is mapped using simple case classes. 2. Quoted DSL: Queries are defined inside a quote block. Quill parses each quoted block of code (quotation) at compile time and translates them to an internal Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) 3. Compile-time query generation: The ctx.run call reads the quotation’s AST and translates it to the target language at compile time, emitting the query string as a compilation message. As the query string is known at compile time, the runtime overhead is very low and similar to using the database driver directly. 4. Compile-time query validation: If configured, the query is verified against the database at compile time, and the compilation fails if it is not valid. The query validation does not alter the database state.   There are Slick and ScalikeJDBC libraries as well.

An example of this solution will be the following (concerning the current infrastructure and services):  prism-node must be able to store the generic resource payload, signature and/or hash on-chain and restore the given resource in the underlying database (PostgreSQL) for indexing and lookup APIcredential schema (or any other resource module) must be a part of the Atala SSI infrastructure and allow publishing the concrete resource as a generic resource using the prism-node APIexpose the API for discovery and fetching the resource by URLexpose the API for managing the resources (create, publish, lookup with pagination) the Universal Resolver for the DID Method must be able to discover and fetch the resource by DID URLis needed, SDK and backend services can fetch the resources directly (not via the Universal Resolver)  Example:  Given the credential schema with the signature:  { &quot;$id&quot;: &quot;driving-license-1.0&quot;, &quot;$schema&quot;: &quot;http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Driving License&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;object&quot;, &quot;properties&quot;: { &quot;credentialSubject&quot;: { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;object&quot;, &quot;properties&quot;: { &quot;emailAddress&quot;: { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;string&quot;, &quot;format&quot;: &quot;email&quot; }, &quot;givenName&quot;: { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;string&quot; }, &quot;familyName&quot;: { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;string&quot; }, &quot;dateOfIssuance&quot;: { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;datetime&quot; }, &quot;drivingLicenseID&quot;: { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;string&quot; }, &quot;drivingClass&quot;: { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;integer&quot; }, &quot;required&quot;: [ &quot;emailAddress&quot;, &quot;familyName&quot;, &quot;dateOfIssuance&quot;, &quot;drivingLicenseID&quot;, &quot;drivingClass&quot; ], &quot;additionalProperties&quot;: true } } }, &quot;proof&quot;: { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;RsaSignature2018&quot;, &quot;created&quot;: &quot;2023-04-18T10:30:00Z&quot;, &quot;jws&quot;: &quot;eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vZXhhbXBsZS5jb20vY3JlZGVudGlhbHMvc3ViamVjdCIsInR5cGUiOiJWZXJpZmljYWxpY0NyZWRlbnRpYWwiLCJpc3N1ZXIiOiJodHRwczovL2V4YW1wbGUuY29tL2lzc3VlciIsImlzc3VlckRhdGUiOiIyMDIzLTA0LTE4VDEwOjMwOjAwWiIsImV4cGlyYXRpb25EYXRlIjoiMjAyNC0wNC0xOFQxMDowOTo1MFoiLCJjcmVkZW50aWFsU3ViamVjdCI6eyJpZCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vZXhhbXBsZS5jb20vY3JlZGVudGlhbHMvc3ViamVjdC9zdWJqZWN0IiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwic2lnbmF0dXJlIjoxMH19.OesuS6eC0gVh8SZpESM7Z4Yln9sGSsJHQ8s0LlcsD99H6_7U6vukUeT2_GZTtuTf9SwIfdtgViFTOfhzGTyM6oMGEeUJv6Umlh6TQ1fTm9XEDQV7JDBiaxRzV7S_vS6i&quot;, &quot;alg&quot;: &quot;RS256&quot; } }   In order to store it as a general resource on-chain, it should be binary encoded into CBOR format (or Base64 encoded string) and the metadata must be added to it.  For example, it might look like the following JSON object:  { &quot;id&quot;: &quot;f3d39687-69f5-4046-a960-3aae86a0d3ca&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;DrivingLicense-1.0&quot;, &quot;resourceType&quot;: &quot;CredentialSchema&quot;, &quot;mediaType&quot;: &quot;application/json&quot;, // MIME Type of the resource &quot;data&quot;: &quot;SGVsbG8sIHdvcmxk&quot;, // base 64 encoded or CBOR file &quot;did&quot;: &quot;did:prism:abdcefg&quot;, // the DID reference to link the resource to the DID and create the anchor to the DID }   ... and published on the Cardano blockchain as a payload of the AtalaOperation object, so can be retrieved from the blockchain and added to the indexed database for resolution by the REST API  Given there is an Agent or CredentialSchema service that exposes the REST API for fetching the credential schema by ID (in the current implementation it corresponds to the Cloud Agent /schema-registry/credential-schema/{uuid}, but later might be changed to /credential-schema/{didRef}/{id}?version={version} )  So, the services of the Identus platform and SDKs can resolve the given schema by URL and use the convenient lookup API with filtering and pagination to manage the credential schema in the Web application.  To define the schemaId in the message of Issue Credential and Present Proof protocols the following DID URL can be used:  did:prism:abcdefg1234567890?service=credentialschema&amp;relativeRef=%2Ff3d39687-69f5-4046-a960-3aae86a0d3ca   The version is skipped as for resolving the single resource we don't need a version parameterf3d39687-69f5-4046-a960-3aae86a0d3ca - is a unique identifier that is derived from the triple: didRef, id and version.  So, having the following service endpoint definition in the DID Document:  { &quot;service&quot;: [ { &quot;id&quot;: &quot;did:prism:abcdefg#credentialschema&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;CredentialSchemaService&quot;, &quot;serviceEndpoint&quot;: &quot;https://agent.example.com/schema-registry/schemas&quot; } ] }   And having the logic for dereferencing the DID URL in the PRISM DID Resolver, any system in the SSI ecosystem can fetch this resource and validate its authorship.  Storing resources larger than 64KB is out of the scope of this ADR. These must be stored in a slightly different way, for instance, the image ~10MB, can be stored and linked to the DID Document in the following way:  the image is stored in the cloud database in a binary formatthe metadata and the hash of the image are stored on-chainoptionally, the signature of the owner DID can be generated for the payload and stored together with the hashto prove the integrity of the image file, the hash of the binary representation must be the same and/or the signature must be verifiedthe resource can be fetched in the same way and the credential schema from the previous example  Positive Consequences​  discoverability: the credential schema or any other resource is discovered using the Universal Resolverscalability: the size of DID document doesn't grow when a new resource is added, the number of the resources is limited by the scalability of the underlying database and the blockchainlongevity: for the resource that can be stored on-chain the longevity is 100% guaranteed by the underlying blockchain technologytrust: is achieved by cryptography and the underlying blockchain technology, the transaction with the resource contains the hashes and the signatures that can be verifiedinteroperability: any system that uses Universal Resolver can fetch the resource by dereferencing the DID URL (following the W3C specification)vendor lock: by publishing the specifications and the algorithms for fetching the data, the resource can be resolved by any other SSI system  Negative Consequences​  longevity: for the resource that can not be stored on-chain because of the large size longevity is guaranteed by the cloud recovery procedures and data backup. As an option for mitigating this problem, the resource can be stored in IPFS (additional ADR is required for this)vendor lock: the solution is coupled to the Cardano blockchain  NOTE: one of the main concerns of this ADR is storing the resources on-chain because of size limitation, throughput, latency and cost. This option allows to postpone this decision and implement the DID-linked resources without the need of storing resources on-chain.

SQL is used in PostgreSQL to save, retrieve, access, and manipulate the database data. While PostgreSQL may be ideal for managing structured data streams, it tends to struggle when dealing with big unstructured data, as maintaining such relations can increase time complexity significantly. Postgres SQL relies on relational data models that need to defined in advance Change in any field in table requires lengthy process of migration scripts run and to maintain but it works there are tools available and we also use it PrismAgent, But maintenance cost of software is higher.  Contrastingly, non-relational databases like MongoDB excel in these scenarios because data isn't constrained to a single table. This approach permits massive data streams to be imported directly into the system without the burden of setting up increasingly complex relationships and keys. MongoDB typically stores data within documents using JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) or BSON (Binary JavaScript Object Notation), which simplifies the handling of big data and complex data streams. document database supports a rapid, iterative cycle of development the way that a document database turns data into code.

An agent can support a single-tenant only.  Each single-tenant agent is accessed via a shared API gateway layer (APISIX) that enforces a consumer restriction list. Only assigned consumers, identified through the pre-shared key, can access specific agent instances.  This authentication/authorisation mechanism poses a significant security risk. If the pre-shared key is leaked, we lack the means to detect its misuse by a nefarious actor, as there is no proof-of-possession mechanism or additional authentication factor in place.  In our Multi-tenant Value Brief, we propose modifications to the agent, enabling it to host multiple tenants within a single instance. Here, a tenant is defined as a unique set of private keys and configurations shared by multiple API consumers.  As we transition to multi-tenancy, several critical questions emerge:  How should the Cloud Agent authenticate, or verify the identities of, its API consumers?How should the Cloud Agent authorise a particular identity to use a specific instance of the agent?As the Cloud Agent becomes capable of hosting multiple tenants whose workloads must remain isolated, how should it become tenant-aware?

This library will meet our defined requirements and strategically position us for future technological advancements.  2.1 Provable Security​  Our cryptographic library will provide engineers with high assurances of security. This will be accomplished by using cryptographic primitives that are secure, with this security being provable through rigorous mathematical proofs. Documentation will accompany these proofs to offer transparency and enable a deeper understanding of the underlying logic and assurances.  2.2 Centralized Cryptography Management​  We propose the creation of a cryptographic library that serves as the central management hub for all cryptographic operations within the Identus platform. By preventing &quot;DIY&quot; implementations, we decrease potential vulnerabilities and establish a standard, thus enhancing overall security across our organization.  2.3 Easy Upgrade Path​  In light of emerging cryptographic needs such as the introduction of quantum-resistant cryptography, our library will be designed with easy upgrades in mind. Its modular design will allow for the seamless introduction of new cryptographic primitives as they become necessary or advisable. This adaptability will ensure that cryptographic upgrades across all of Identus' components are consistent and efficient.  2.4 Code Reusability​  Our library will make the most of Kotlin Multiplatform's capabilities for code reuse across different platforms.

Anyone inquiring about the features or algorithms we support will have a clear and accessible resource to answer their questions. We plan to provide a complete list of features that Apollo offers, document them, and make this information accessible to everyone. Apollo will fully document its public APIs in terms of cryptography, compliance, supported algorithms, and key curves. While TypeScript could temporarily survive without WASM, we would significantly benefit from offering native performance for cryptographic libraries through WASM for browsers. Apollo will be tested using best practices, and over time we aim to raise the minimum test coverage threshold. Best practices and quality assurance will be addressed in a collaborative way between Cryptography and engineering, Cryptography engineers will be in charge of making sure our security is robust enough and properly tested and potentially helping us drive unit testing better.

This can be achieved through logical partitions, such as separate databases, schemas, tables or Row Security Policies (RSP in the PostgreSQL) Physical Separation: In addition to logical separation, physical separation can provide an extra layer of isolation. This involves segregating tenants' data into separate physical resources, such as servers, storage devices, or networks. Physical separation helps prevent data leakage or unauthorized access between tenants.  Logical and Physical Separations define the level of isolation for storage, connection pool, and computation resources: CPU, RAM, and Disk I/0.  Access Controls: Robust access controls should be implemented to restrict access to each tenant's data. This includes authentication mechanisms to verify the identity of users or applications accessing the data and authorization rules to define what actions they are allowed to perform. Each tenant's access should be limited to their data and not extend beyond their boundaries. Data Encryption: To protect data at rest and in transit, encryption techniques should be employed. This ensures that even if unauthorized access occurs, the data remains unreadable without the appropriate decryption keys. Encryption can be applied at various levels, including the application, database, or file system. Data encryption at rest and in transit is a matter of infrastructure configuration and shouldn't play a significant role in the following ADR. Tenant-Specific Configuration: Each tenant may have specific configuration requirements, such as custom data schemas, access controls, or data retention policies. The system should allow for flexible configuration options to accommodate these individual tenant needs while maintaining isolation. For simplification, in the scope of the following ADR, all tenants will not have the custom configuration, but it can be implemented by having one of the following physical separations, such as separated schemas or instances of the database. Auditing and Logging: Comprehensive logging and auditing mechanisms should be in place to track and monitor access to tenants' data. This helps in detecting any unauthorized activities or potential breaches and provides an audit trail for forensic analysis if needed. Auditing and Logging should provide visibility if the tenant tried to access the data that don't belong to it and the basic statistic to determine resource unitisation by the tenant (requests/sec, request latency). Data Backup and Recovery: Robust data backup and recovery processes should be implemented to ensure the availability and integrity of tenants' data. Regular backups should be taken and securely stored, with mechanisms in place to restore data in the event of data loss or system failures. The current aspect corresponds to the SRE area and will not be taken into account in the following ADR and can be guaranteed by the infrastructure layer. Performance and Scalability: Data isolation mechanisms should be designed to minimize performance impacts and provide scalability. The architecture should be able to handle increasing numbers of tenants and their data without sacrificing performance or compromising isolation. The Complexity of the Implementation: It's essential to build the multi-tenancy capability for the Identus platform without the introduction of unnecessary complexity at the application layer, operation layer, and maintenance, in a way that allows evolving the platform naturally along with the growth of the users, scalability requirements, and real business needs.

So, these options also can be considered for organizations with a lot of tenants to provide better isolation and data protection guarantees. These two options are excellent for a group of tenants under a single organisation or can be considered for tenants that require geographical separation of data, but should not be used for a single tenant.  Moreover, for the SaaS application to manage thousands of organizations and millions of tenants, the Row Security Policies option will not be enough because of the resource limitations and amount of requests to the database. In this case, one of the PostgreSQL sharding options is required together with Row Security Policies. So, either Citus extension or Amazon RDS sharding should be used.

If we opt for the minimum size of 16 KB for the revocation status list, it can manage up to 131,072 revocable credentials before requiring expansion. It's important to note that this number represents the potential capacity for revocable credentials to be issued, not necessarily the actual number of credentials that have been revoked. Even unrevoked credentials still occupy space.  Option 2: Generate multiple revocation status lists as the previous one reaches its limit  With this approach, we'll generate and store multiple status list credentials. It will be crucial to ensure that each credential is linked to a specific status list, allowing us to track where the revocation information is stored.

It is also important to note that Option 2 isn't significantly more challenging to implement, so we shouldn't overly prioritize this consideration.  One potential drawback of Option 1 is that the size of the status list could potentially become too large, leading to slower verification due to the increased payload of the verification status list credential. However, it's worth noting that the verification status list credential is gZipped. This means that consecutive 0s and 1s will be compressed. For example, a sequence of 5 zeros (00000) will be stored as 5(0), indicating five consecutive zeros. Assuming that most credentials won't be revoked and will have an index of 0 in the status list, the gzipped status list in the status list credential should be very compact. This is the most crucial factor to consider in the end.  Option 2​  Option 2 slightly reduces privacy compared to Option 1 in certain scenarios. For example, in cases where the number of Verifiable Credentials (VCs) starts small but grows over time. Initially, both options face the same issue with a small anonymity set due to the limited number of VCs issued. As the number of VCs increases, Option 1 maintains a continuously growing anonymity set. However, in Option 2, when the issuer reaches the 16KB limit and creates a new list, there will be a period where the new list has only a few VCs, resulting in a smaller anonymity set for VCs in the second list.  Option 2 however, has a big advantage considering upcoming need for AnonCreds revocation. AnonCreds doesn't allow for expanding the status list size once defined during revocation registry creation. Pushing back Option 2 for AnonCreds and starting with an initial capacity of 1 million credentials may not be efficient. The size of the attached TAILS FILE grows rapidly with capacity (e.g., 8.4MB for 32,768 VCs!). This file needs to be resolved/downloaded by the holder during the issuance process.

It is more challenging when a problem is identified significantly later or in a different location from where it originated, involving collaboration among various parties for a solution. For DIDComm, the aspect of interoperability is especially critical in the context of problem reporting.

As of the time of writing, the Cloud Agent supports 3 DIDComm flows: Connection, Issuance and Verification.Each Cloud Agent operates a background thread that facilitates interactions between two agents. For each flow, the agent tracks a protocol state, and depending on this state, it triggers a DIDComm(V2) message to communicate with the other agent. The communication between two agents, Agent A and Agent B, occurs asynchronously in the background job.

Dynamic resources will be signed by the resource creator's key.DID URLs and traditional HTTP servers: in this variation, resources are still stored in servers. Resources are identified by DID URLs that dereference services of the associated DID document. The services will contain the final URL to retrieve the corresponding resources.

However, effectively handling errors within the context of ZIO presents challenges that must be addressed.  Within our software development projects utilising ZIO, the management and handling of errors have emerged as areas requiring more clarity and strategy. The existing practices have shown limitations in terms of their efficiency and comprehensiveness.  The key issues are:  Lack of Consistent Error Handling Strategies: There's inconsistency in error handling across different modules and components of our ZIO-based applications, making it challenging to maintain a unified approach.Understanding and Communicating Errors: There's a need for a clearer method to categorise errors and communicate these effectively within the team and across various layers, facilitating quicker identifications and resolutions.Optimising Error Recovery Mechanisms: While ZIO provides powerful abstractions for error recovery, there's a necessity to optimise these mechanisms to ensure graceful degradation and resilience in our applications.  This ADR aims to explore and define strategies for utilising ZIO's capabilities more effectively in handling errors. It will outline decision drivers, available options, their pros and cons, and ultimately, the recommended approach to enhance our error management practices with the ZIO framework.  Effective management of errors directly impacts the reliability, maintainability, and customer experience of our applications.  By addressing the challenges of consistent error handling, we aim to enhance the stability of our products, ensuring reduced downtime, clearer communication with customers through structured error messages, and quicker issue resolution.  This not only improves the overall customer experience but also accelerates feature delivery as developers can focus more on implementing new functionalities rather than troubleshooting ad-hoc errors. The resulting streamlined development process contributes to cost reduction and optimised resource allocation.  In essence, these efforts are customer-centric, aiming to deliver a reliable, efficient, and customer-friendly service interface that positively impacts the overall customer experience and product adoption.

This segregation should be done according to the principles outlined in the ZIO Types of Errors documentation section. That is, carefully distinguishing between:  ZIO Failures The expected/recoverable errors (i.e. domain-specific errors).Declared in the Error channel of the effect =&gt; ZIO[R, E, A].Supposed to be handled by the caller to prevent call stack propagation. ZIO Defects The unexpected/unrecoverable errors.Not represented in the ZIO effect.We do NOT expect the caller to handle them.Propagated throughout the call stack until converted to a Failure or logged for traceability and debugging purposes by the uppermost layer.  Use ADT to Model ZIO Failures​  Use Algebraic Data Types (ADTs) to model domain-specific errors as ZIO failures within the component/service interface.  Implementation tips:  Use a sealed trait or abstract class to represent the hierarchy of ZIO Failures, allowing for a well-defined set of error possibilities.Define specific error cases within the companion object of the sealed trait. This practice prevents potential conflicts when importing errors with common names (e.g. RecordNotFoundError), allowing users to prefix them with the name of the parent sealed trait for better code clarity.  Example:  sealed trait DomainError object DomainError { final case class BusinessLogicError(message: String) extends DomainError final case class DataValidationError(message: String) extends DomainError }   Use Scala 3 Union Types to Be More Specific About ZIO Failure Types​  Using the Scala 3 Union Types feature to declare the expected failures of a ZIO effect should be preferred over using the broader and more generic top-level sealed trait. This allows for a more explicit and detailed definition of potential failure scenarios and enhances error handling accuracy on the caller side.  This principle is outlined in the following section of the ZIO Error Management Best Practices documentation.  Example:  trait MyService { def myMethod(): ZIO[Any, BusinessLogicError | DataValidationError, Unit] }   Don’t Type Unexpected Errors (i.e. ZIO Defects)​  When we first discover typed errors, it may be tempting to put every error into the ZIO failure type parameter/channel. That is a mistake because we can't recover from all types of errors. When we encounter unexpected errors we can't do anything with, we should let the application die (i.e. the ZIO fiber). This is known as the “Let it Crash” principle, and it is a good approach for all unexpected errors.  This principle is outlined in the following section of the ZIO Error Management Best Practices documentation.

Any unhandled failures should be transformed into defects and propagated through the call stack. You should not expect callers of your component to handle lower-level failures that you do not handle.  Use Failure Wrappers To Prevent Failures Leakage From Lower Layers​  Do not directly expose their failure types in your component interface when invoking lower-level components. Use wrappers to encapsulate and abstract failure types originating from lower-level components, thus enhancing loose coupling and safeguarding against leakage of underlying implementation details to the caller.  Using failure wrappers and propagating them should not be the default strategy. Lower-level failures should primarily be managed at your component implementation level, ensuring that it appropriately handles and recovers them.  Failures not handled within the component's boundaries should preferably be transformed into defects whenever possible.  Do not reflexively log errors​  Avoid catching a ZIO failure or defect solely for the purpose of logging it. Instead, consider allowing the error to propagate through the call stack. It's preferable to assume that the uppermost layer, commonly known as 'the end of the world' will handle the logging of those errors. This practice promotes a centralised and consistent logging approach for better traceability and debugging.  This principle is outlined in the following section of the ZIO Error Management Best Practices documentation.

Doobie will report any database error as a subclass of Throwable, and its specific type will be directly linked to the underlying database implementation (i.e. PostgreSQL). Handling it this way means there is no deterministic way to recover from an SQL execution error in a database-agnostic way.  A good approach is to use ZIO Defects to report repository errors, declaring all repository methods as URIOor UIO(example). Conversely, declaring them as Task assumes that the caller (i.e. service) can properly handle and recover from the low-level and database-specific exceptions exposed in the error channel, which is a fallacy.  trait ConnectionRepository { def findAll: URIO[WalletAccessContext, Seq[ConnectionRecord]] }   Converting a ZIO Task to ZIO UIO can easily be done using ZIO#orDie(example).  class JdbcConnectionRepository(xa: Transactor[ContextAwareTask], xb: Transactor[Task]) extends ConnectionRepository { override def findAll: URIO[WalletAccessContext, Seq[ConnectionRecord]] = { val cxnIO = sql&quot;&quot;&quot; | SELECT | id, | created_at, | ... | FROM public.connection_records | ORDER BY created_at &quot;&quot;&quot;.stripMargin .query[ConnectionRecord] .to[Seq] cxnIO .transactWallet(xa) .orDie } }   For those cases where one has to generate a defect, a common way to do this is by using the following ZIO construct (example):  class JdbcConnectionRepository(xa: Transactor[ContextAwareTask], xb: Transactor[Task]) extends ConnectionRepository { override def getById(recordId: UUID): URIO[WalletAccessContext, ConnectionRecord] = for { maybeRecord &lt;- findById(recordId) record &lt;- ZIO.fromOption(maybeRecord).orDieWith(_ =&gt; RuntimeException(s&quot;Record not found: $recordId&quot;)) } yield record }   Apply the get vs find pattern​  Follow the get and find best practices in the repository interface for read operations:  getXxx() returns the requested record or throws an unexpected exception/defect when not found (example).findXxx() returns an Option with or without the request record, which allows the caller service to handle the foundand not-found cases and report appropriately to the end user (example).  trait ConnectionRepository { def findById(recordId: UUID): URIO[WalletAccessContext, Option[ConnectionRecord]] def getById(recordId: UUID): URIO[WalletAccessContext, ConnectionRecord] }   Do not return the affected row count​  The create, update or delete repository methods should not return an Int indicating the number of rows affected by the operation but either return Unit when successful or throw an exception/defect when the row count is not what is expected, like i.e. an update operation resulting in a 0 affected row count (example).  class JdbcConnectionRepository(xa: Transactor[ContextAwareTask], xb: Transactor[Task]) extends ConnectionRepository { override def create(record: ConnectionRecord): URIO[WalletAccessContext, Unit] = { val cxnIO = sql&quot;&quot;&quot; | INSERT INTO public.connection_records( | id, | created_at, | ... | ) values ( | ${record.id}, | ${record.createdAt}, | ... | ) &quot;&quot;&quot;.stripMargin.update cxnIO.run .transactWallet(xa) .ensureOneAffectedRowOrDie } } extension[Int](ma: RIO[WalletAccessContext, Int]) { def ensureOneAffectedRowOrDie: URIO[WalletAccessContext, Unit] = ma.flatMap { case 1 =&gt; ZIO.unit case count =&gt; ZIO.fail(RuntimeException(s&quot;Unexpected affected row count: $count&quot;)) }.orDie }   Do not reflexively log errors​  The upper layer will automatically do so appropriately and consistently using Tapir interceptor customization.

Following the above rules, the update method will throw a defect that will be caught at the upper level and returns a generic 500 Internal Server Error to the user.  For those cases where a specific error like 404 should be returned, it is up to the service to first call find()before update() and construct a NotFound failure, propagated through the error channel, if it gives a None (example).  Relying on the service layer to implement it will guarantee consistent behavior regardless of the underlying database type (could be different RDMS flavor, No-SQL, etc.).  class ConnectionServiceImpl() extends ConnectionService { override def markConnectionRequestSent(recordId: UUID): ZIO[WalletAccessContext, RecordIdNotFound | InvalidStateForOperation, ConnectionRecord] = for { maybeRecord &lt;- connectionRepository.findById(recordId) record &lt;- ZIO.fromOption(maybeRecord).mapError(_ =&gt; RecordIdNotFound(recordId)) updatedRecord &lt;- updateConnectionProtocolState( recordId, ProtocolState.ConnectionRequestPending, ProtocolState.ConnectionRequestSent ) } yield updatedRecord }   Do not type unexpected errors​  Do not wrap defects from lower layers (typically repository) in a failure and error case class declarations like thisshould be prohibited.  Considering that failures are viewed as expected errors from which users can potentially recover, error case classes like UnexpectedError should be prohibited (example).  Extend the common Failure trait​  Make sure all service errors extend the shared trait org.hyperledger.identus.shared.models.Failure. This allows handling &quot;at the end of the world“ to be done in a consistent and in generic way.  Create an exhaustive and meaningful list of service errors and make sure the value of the userFacingMessage attribute is chosen wisely! It will present &quot;as is&quot; to the user and should not contain any sensitive data (example).  trait Failure { val statusCode: StatusCode val userFacingMessage: String } sealed trait ConnectionServiceError( val statusCode: StatusCode, val userFacingMessage: String ) extends Failure object ConnectionServiceError { final case class InvitationAlreadyReceived(invitationId: String) extends ConnectionServiceError( StatusCode.BadRequest, s&quot;The provided invitation has already been used: invitationId=$invitationId&quot; ) }   User Input Validation​  Enforcing user input validation (business invariants) should primarily sit at the service layer and be implemented using theZIO Prelude framework.  While partially implementing user input validation at the REST entry point level via OpenAPI specification, it is crucial to enforce validation at the service level as well. This implementation ensures consistency and reliability across all interfaces that may call our services, recognizing that REST may not be the sole interface interacting with our services.  class ConnectionServiceImpl() extends ConnectionService { def validateInputs( label: Option[String], goalCode: Option[String], goal: Option[String] ): IO[UserInputValidationError, Unit] = { val validation = Validation .validate( ValidationUtils.validateLengthOptional(&quot;label&quot;, label, 0, 255), ValidationUtils.validateLengthOptional(&quot;goalCode&quot;, goalCode, 0, 255), ValidationUtils.validateLengthOptional(&quot;goal&quot;, goal, 0, 255) ) .unit ZIO.fromEither(validation.toEither).mapError(UserInputValidationError.apply) } }   Modeling validation errors should use a dedicated error case class and, when possible, provide validation failure details. One could use a construct like the following:  sealed trait ConnectionServiceError( val statusCode: StatusCode, val userFacingMessage: String ) extends Failure object ConnectionServiceError { final case class UserInputValidationError(errors: NonEmptyChunk[String]) extends ConnectionServiceError( StatusCode.BadRequest, s&quot;The provided input failed validation: errors=${errors.mkString(&quot;[&quot;, &quot;], [&quot;, &quot;]&quot;)}&quot; ) }   Use Scala 3 Union Types​  Use Scala 3 union-types declaration in the effect’s error channel to notify the caller of potential failures (example)  class ConnectionServiceImpl() extends ConnectionService { override def receiveConnectionRequest(request: ConnectionRequest, expirationTime: Option[Duration] = None): ZIO[WalletAccessContext, ThreadIdNotFound | InvalidStateForOperation | InvitationExpired, ConnectionRecord] = ??? }   Do not reflexively log errors​  The upper layer will automatically do so appropriately and consistently using Tapir interceptor customization.

","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Authentication flow​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Authenticate","url":"/identus-docs/docs/identus/identus-cloud-agent/authenticate#authentication-flow","content":" On a high level, the authentication flow starts with the application creating a challenge, encoding it, and sending it to the other party. The other party then uses their SSI wallet to respond to the challenge by signing the nonce and sending it back to the submission endpoint specified in the challenge.  Let's go through the whole process in more detail.  Application creates a new authentication challenge. The challenge contains a nonce, expiration time, and submission endpoint. It also includes a type field used as a protocol identifier for wallets to understand how to process the message.  An example of an authentication challenge state:  { &quot;self&quot;: &quot;https://demo.atalaprism.io/did-authentication/challenges/challenge-id-1234&quot;, &quot;kind&quot;: &quot;AuthenticationChallengeState&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: &quot;challenge-id-1234&quot;, &quot;challenge&quot;: { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;https://atalaprism.io/authentication-challenge&quot;, &quot;submissionEndpoint&quot;: &quot;https://demo.atalaprism.io:8085/did-authentication/challenge-submissions/request-id-1234&quot;, &quot;nonce&quot;: &quot;authenticate-NzIxZTZmNjQtOGY0Ni00ODQ4LWFhYjAtZGYzNDJmYzNlMjM2&quot;, &quot;from&quot;: &quot;Application ABC&quot;, &quot;expireAt&quot;: &quot;2021-10-31T09:22:23Z&quot; }, &quot;did&quot;: null, &quot;state&quot;: &quot;pending&quot;, &quot;createdAt&quot;: &quot;2023-02-24T19:13:23Z&quot;, &quot;updatedAt&quot;: &quot;2023-02-24T19:13:23Z&quot; }   It contains a challenge field and other metadata which makes it possible to track the challenge over time.  Note: Only the challenge field should be encoded and sent to the other side!  It is possible to add the optional from field too. It is a human-readable label that represents the party requesting authentication. Wallets could use this label later to display information to users about who is sending requests.  The initial state is pending, and did field is null.  Next, the challenge object is encoded, typically as a QR code or deep link, depending on the use case. The encoded challenge is then presented or sent to the other party.  Now, the receiving party uses their wallet to decode and process the received authentication challenge. In this case, the type field gets checked for valuehttps://atalaprism.io/authentication-challenge. The wallet then should present a prompt to the user to accept or reject the request, showing the optionalfrom label. If the user accepts the request, the next step is to instruct the wallet which DID to use to respond to the challenge. The authentication key from the selected DID signs the nonce field and sends the signature, and the used DID to the submission endpoint specified in the challenge.  Upon receiving the response, the Authenticate service verifies the signature and updates the challenge state accordingly. In the case of an invalid signature, the state changes to error. In the case of a valid signature, the state is set tosuccess and the did field gets populated with the DID used to sign the response.  During the process, an application can query the state of the sent authentication challenge to check the response status and if it's valid. As mentioned, the terminal state is either error or success. Once the challenge response is received, the application can act upon it, depending on the business logic. For example, creating a login session for the user based on JWT.  Note: Authenticate service only checks if the signature is valid, based on the DID used to sign the response. Checking if the given DID is known to the application is the application's responsibility.

We will demonstrate how to add DID-based authentication to an existing application, which already has a user database and supports password-based login.  Note: This aims to 'sketch' or illustrate the general flow. This example is just one of many possible ways to implement this flow. The intent of the code herein is for demonstration purposes only, not for execution.  The example code is in JavaScript/TypeScript, but it should be easy to translate it to any other language. API could be consumed directly or via a generated client library. For example,Orval tool can generate a TypeScript API client from OpenAPI spec.  npx orval --input ./enterprise-services-spec.yml --output ./prism-api-client.ts   Let's use this hypothetical user model as an example:  interface User { id: string; email: string; password: string; did?: string; name: string; company?: string; }   Here is the implementation of the endpoint called by the application front-end to start the DID-based login flow. A new authentication challenge is created and encoded as a QR code.  async function handleDidAuthRequest() { // we are using generated API client here to interact with Authenticate service. const authChallengeState = await prismApiClient.createAuthenticationChallenge({ from: 'Application ABC', }); // depends on the use-case: QR code, deep link or something else! const encodedAuthChallenge = encodeAsQrCode(authChallengeState.challenge); await respondWithSuccessToApplicationFrontend(authChallengeState.id, encodedAuthChallenge); console.info(`Challenge &quot;${authChallengeState.id}&quot; has been created and sent to the front-end.`); }   Once the QR code gets presented to the user for scanning with their mobile wallet, the front-end app could call an endpoint to track the challenge state and wait for the response.  async function trackAuthChallengeState(challengeId) { while (true) { const authChallengeState = await prismApiClient.getAuthenticationChallenge(challengeId); // expiration time default is 2 minutes if (isExpired(authChallengeState.challenge.expireAt)) { console.info(`Challenge &quot;${authChallengeState.id}&quot; has been expired`); return respondWithErrorToApplicationFrontend(&quot;CHALLENGE_EXPIRED&quot;); } if (authChallengeState.state === &quot;error&quot;) { // invalid response has been received - either invalid signature or invalid body format console.info(`Invalid response to challenge &quot;${authChallengeState.id}&quot; has been received`); return respondWithErrorToApplicationFrontend(&quot;INVALID_CHALLENGE_RESPONSE&quot;); } if (authChallengeState.state === &quot;success&quot;) { console.info(`Valid response to challenge &quot;${authChallengeState.id}&quot; has been received`); console.info(`Challenge signed with DID: &quot;${authChallengeState.did}&quot;`); // user has to use DID which is already registered in the application! const userData = await getUserByDid(authChallengeState.did); if (!userData) { return respondWithErrorToApplicationFrontend(&quot;UNKNOWN_DID&quot;); } // create JWT access token, in the same way as it's done for password-based login const accessToken = jwt.sign({ userId: userData.id }, process.env.JWT_SECRET, { expiresIn: &quot;1h&quot;, }); return respondWithSuccessToApplicationFrontend({ accessToken, userData: { id: userData.id, did: userData.did, email: userData.email, } }); } // challenge is still pending - wait for a while and check again await wait(5000); } }   Note: Please be aware that the Authenticate service currently does not provide an eventing mechanism. Therefore, the application is responsible for periodically checking the challenge state. However, when eventing gets implemented, this portion will be easier to cover reliably.

By leveraging the blockchain's security and decentralization, the PRISM Node stores and retrieves data in a secure and immutable manner.

The PRISM Node runs alongside a blockchain. It keeps the internal state synchronized with the underlying blockchain and indexed for efficient lookup operations.

The other party then uses their wallet to scan/receive the DID request and send back the existing or new DID.  Let's go through the whole process in more detail.  The inviting party creates a so-called &quot;DID request.&quot; An example of a request state:  { &quot;self&quot;: &quot;https://demo.atalaprism.io/did-requests/did-request-1234&quot;, &quot;kind&quot;: &quot;DidRequestState&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: &quot;did-request-1234&quot;, &quot;didRequest&quot;: { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;https://atalaprism.io/did-request&quot;, &quot;onboardEndpoint&quot;: &quot;https://demo.atalaprism.io:8085/request-id-1234&quot;, &quot;from&quot;: &quot;Application ABC&quot; }, &quot;did&quot;: null, &quot;state&quot;: &quot;pending&quot;, &quot;createdAt&quot;: &quot;2023-02-24T10:22:23Z&quot;, &quot;updatedAt&quot;: &quot;2023-02-24T10:22:23Z&quot; }   It contains the didRequest field and other metadata that makes tracking the requesting possible.  Note: Only the didRequest field should be encoded and sent to the other side!  The optional from field could be added too. It is a human-readable label that represents the inviting party. Wallets could use this label later to display information to users about who is sending request.  The initial state is pending, and did field is null.  Next, the didRequest object is encoded depending on the use case, typically as a QR code or deep link. The encoded request gets sent to the other party via an appropriate channel: email, chat message, or presenting directly in a web app.  Now, the receiving party uses their wallet to decode and process the received DID request. The type of message is identifiable by the type field. In the case of DID request, it is https://atalaprism.io/did-request. The wallet then should present a prompt to the user to accept or reject the request, showing optionallyfrom label. If the user accepts the request, the wallet creates a new relationship and sends its DID back to the onboardEndpoint specified in the DID request.  During the process, the inviting party can query the sent DID request's state to check the response status. The terminal state is either error orsuccess with received DID in did field. Once the DID is received, depending on the business logic, the application can act upon it, for example, associate it with a user ID in the main application state.  Note: DID request is for one-time use only. The request is invalidated if the response is received and is not reusable.

To run it on Cardano, you must set the NODE_LEDGER environment variable to cardano. If you do this, Node will utilize the Cardano wallet backend and DB-sync to query for blocks and submit transactions. It is crucial to have the Cardano wallet backend and DB-sync running before running the Node with NODE_LEDGER set to cardano.  Most up-to-date instructions on how to run the Cardano wallet backend and DB-sync are available in their respective repositories:  Cardano wallet backendDB-sync  Once you have these services up and running, specify their respective URLs in the environment variables of the Node:  Cardano wallet backend NODE_CARDANO_WALLET_API_HOST for wallet server hostNODE_CARDANO_WALLET_API_PORT for wallet server portNODE_CARDANO_WALLET_ROUTING_HEADER_NAME for wallet routing header name DB-sync NODE_CARDANO_DB_SYNC_HOST for DB-sync host and port in a format host:portNODE_CARDANO_DB_SYNC_DATABASE the databse name in DB-sync postgres databaseNODE_CARDANO_DB_SYNC_USERNAME DB-sync Database usernameNODE_CARDANO_DB_SYNC_PASSWORD DB-sync Database password  When running the Node with Cardano ledger, you must specify which network to use, either mainnet or testnet, using the NODE_CARDANO_NETWORK environment variable. While this environment variable is essential for the correct operation of the Node, it does not define the usable network. As mentioned earlier, the interface communicates with the Cardano node; subsequently, the network is DB-sync and Cardano wallet backend. Therefore, when configuring those services, you must specify the network used in their respective configurations. It is possible to run DB-sync on testnet, and Cardano wallet backend on mainnet, and select either one via NODE_CARDANO_NETWORK. The Node won't report any errors, but this configuration would be incorrect and won't work correctly. You are responsible for syncing these three components. If you intend to use the testnet, set NODE_CARDANO_NETWORK to the testnet, but also run Cardano wallet backend connected to the testnet and start DB-sync to sync from the Node that is also running on the testnet as well. The same goes with mainnet.  Apart from that, you must also provide the Wallet ID and its spending password as environment variables as well:  NODE_CARDANO_WALLET_ID - The wallet ID must be in hex-encoded format, and the wallet must belong to the network you are running the Node on, which can be either testnet or mainnetNODE_CARDANO_WALLET_PASSPHRAS - Spending password or wallet above  The Node utilizes Cardano as a decentralized open database, and its implementation is similar to the DIF Sidetree Protocol. In short, the Node stores all relevant information in a Cardano transaction metadata and sends 1 ADA (minimum allowed amount) to another address, which you must provide via the NODE_CARDANO_PAYMENT_ADDRESS environment variable, which will store arbitrary information on the blockchain. In most cases, you don't need to specify a particular address for sending transactions as long as the transaction gets recorded. In this case, you should set NODE_CARDANO_PAYMENT_ADDRESS to the same address you are sending transactions from, NODE_CARDANO_WALLET_ID. In this configuration, you are not spending any ADA other than the transaction fee for every transaction. Suppose your wallet does not have enough ADA to cover the transaction fee (plus 1 ADA to send to yourself). In that case, the transaction won't get recorded, and your operation, which includes any DID-related action, won't be submitted.  The last component is the database that the Node uses internally to index Identus cloud agent related Cardano transactions and maintain the state of DID documents. It is a simple PostgreSQL version 13 database, and you can use the Docker image postgres:13 to run it.  When running the Node, you must specify the host, database name, username, and password of this database via environment variables.  NODE_PSQL_HOST - host with a port, in a format host:portNODE_PSQL_DATABASE - database nameNODE_PSQL_USERNAME - usernameNODE_PSQL_PASSWORD - password  The Node gRPC server has three dependencies: Node DB, Cardano wallet, and DB-sync. You need to run these three services before starting the Node.  Node DB is a simple PostgreSQL database.  Cardano wallet is an application that communicates with the Cardano network; it functions as a server that you can start and connect to either the mainnet or testnet. You must provide the Node runnable's host and port as environment variables.  DB-sync is an application responsible for syncing the Cardano blockchain with a PostgreSQL database. It would help if you used it to sync with either the mainnet or testnet and must provide the database host with port, database name, and credentials as environment variables to the Node runnable.

This guide will familiarize you with the general concepts and how to create decentralized identifiers (DIDs), issue credentials, make connections, and verify credentials with verifiable presentations. Refer to the Concepts and Components sections for a more in-depth explanation.  The trust triangle is the most basic process for conveying trust in the digital world. There are three roles in an SSI ecosystem: Holders, Issuers, and Verifiers.    Holders can be any entity, such as individuals, organizations, and digital or physical things. They will hold verifiable credentials (VCs) and use a verifiable presentation to share their VCs.  Issuers can also be any entity that makes claims about an entity. These claims are attestations, or evidence of something, about the Holder. As an example, an insurance company would provide proof of valid insurance.  Verifiers are the relying party in the triangle. They will request information from the Holder, such as proof of insurance, and the Holder will use a verifiable presentation to share the appropriate VCs with the Verifier. The Holder's digital signature, the issuer DID get verified, and the contents therein to ensure nothing has been tampered with.

This update mechanism is implementation specific and links the DID update-operation from the last confirmed operation observed on the blockchain.  When updating a DID, there is a waiting period for the update to be confirmed on the blockchain. If the DID Controller updates the DID before the previous update is confirmed, it can create a situation where the sequence of updates splits into two separate paths, which is not allowed according to the protocol. This happens because the Cloud Agent connects the update operation to the latest confirmed update. Once the pending update operation is confirmed, any other pending operation that does not link to the latest confirmed operation will be discarded. The subsequent updates continuing from that operation will also be discarded. However, the Cloud Agent has a safeguard in place to prevent this issue by rejecting multiple updates submitted on the same DID while previous updates are still being processed.  Please refer to the SECURE_DEPTH parameter in PRISM method - protocol parameters for the number of confirmation blocks. At the time of writing, this number is 112 blocks.

The administrator can then create a UMA permission for the wallet, giving access to the tenant.  When setting up UMA permissions on the agent, the wallet resource, along with the UMA policy and permission are created on Keycloak according to a predefined convention. For flexibility in defining custom policy and permission models, administrators can manually create these UMA resources (resource, policy, permission) directly on Keycloak using a set of UMA endpoints called Protection API (see Keycloak Protection API). However, using Protection API to manage permissions is out of the scope of this tutorial.  Once the registration is successful, the tenant can obtain an ID token from Keycloak using any available OIDC flow, such as the direct access grants (username &amp; password). This ID token typically contains user claims such as username and subject ID. The tenant can use Keycloak's token endpoint to convert this token to an RPT (requesting party token), another token containing permissions information. The tenant can access the multi-tenant agent by providing the RPT in the Authorization header.

To generate a DID key material, the software relies on a seed, following the BIP32 / BIP39 standards. The system operators have the option to either provide their own seed or allow the software to generate one automatically. However, in a production environment, it is crucial for the system operators to explicitly supply the seed to the agent. This ensures full control over the DID key material and guarantees secure management of user identities.  The Cloud Agent uses the following environment variables for secret management.

","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"HashiCorp Vault​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Operating an agent with secrets","url":"/identus-docs/tutorials/secrets/operation#hashicorp-vault","content":" When operating in a production environment, the agent has the option to utilize Vault as a secure secret storage backend. This choice is deemed suitable for production because all data is encrypted and it also offers additional security-related capabilities. By default, the agent uses this backend but the option is configurable. To utilize this backend, set the SECRET_STORAGE_BACKEND variable to vault.  Authentication and Authorization  The agent expects to read and write secrets to the path /secret/*, so ensure the appropriate permissions are provisioned.  Example Vault policy  path &quot;secret/*&quot; { capabilities = [&quot;create&quot;, &quot;read&quot;, &quot;update&quot;, &quot;patch&quot;, &quot;delete&quot;, &quot;list&quot;] }   HashiCorp Vault provides multiple authentication methods. One of the simplest methods is token authentication. To authenticate using the token, set the environment variable VAULT_TOKEN. The agent prefers token authentication if provided with multiple authentication methods.  Another method is AppRole authentication which is suitable for automatic workflows. To use AppRole authentication, set the environment variable VAULT_APPROLE_ROLE_ID and VAULT_APPROLE_SECRET_ID.  Storage Backend  HashiCorp Vault supports multiple backends for storage, such as filesystem, Etcd, PostgreSQL, or Integrated Storage (Raft). Each backend has different properties, which have implications for how secrets can be stored. The agent logically stores secrets in the following hierarchies.  # Wallet seed /secret/&lt;wallet-id&gt;/seed # Peer DID keys /secret/&lt;wallet-id&gt;/dids/peer/&lt;peer-did&gt;/keys/&lt;key-id&gt; # Generic secrets /secret/&lt;wallet-id&gt;/generic-secrets/&lt;specific-path&gt;   Each storage backend has certain limitations, such as size, number of sub-paths, or path length. Some backends can support path lengths of up to 32,768 characters, while others only allow a few hundred characters. In some cases, the storage backends might not support the above logical convention due to excessively long paths.  To address this issue, the agent supports path shortening. This feature can be toggled by setting the environment variable VAULT_USE_SEMANTIC_PATH=false. When it is disabled, the unbounded portion of the path will be replaced by a SHA-256 digest of the original relative path. Additionally, the original path will be stored in the secret metadata.

However, this option must be explicitly chosen and will replace Vault. By opting for Postgres, there is no need for an additional service like Vault, which simplifies the process of setting up a local development instance.

To enable this option, set the SECRET_STORAGE_BACKEND to postgres, and it will utilize the same database configuration as the agent's database. It is important to note that while this option facilitates an easier development experience, it does not provide a secure method of storing secrets.

Global webhooks capture all events that happen on the Cloud Agent across all wallets, whereas wallet webhooks only capture events that are specific to assets within a particular wallet.  Enable global webhook using environment variables​  The Cloud Agent uses the following environment variables to manage global webhook notifications:  Name\tDescription\tDefaultGLOBAL_WEBHOOK_URL\tThe webhook endpoint URL where the notifications will be sent\tnull GLOBAL_WEBHOOK_API_KEY\tThe optional API key (bearer token) to use as the Authorization header\tnull  Enable wallet webhook for default wallet using environment variables​  In a multi-tenant scenario, the Cloud Agent can optionally create a default wallet to simplify the development and deployment process. The webhook configuration for this default wallet can be defined using environment variables. After the default wallet is created, its webhook settings are stored in the system and are no longer influenced by these environment variables.

Consider the following best practices when securing your webhook endpoint:  Use HTTPS to encrypt communication between the Cloud Agent and the webhook endpoint.Implement authentication mechanisms (e.g., API keys, tokens) to verify the authenticity of incoming requests.Validate and sanitize incoming webhook requests to mitigate potential security risks.  One of the authorization mechanism for the Cloud Agent's webhook notifications is the bearer token. If configured, the token will be included in the Authorization header of the HTTP request sent by the agent to the webhook endpoint. You can configure this bearer token by setting the value of theGLOBAL_WEBHOOK_API_KEY or DEFAULT_WALLET_WEBHOOK_API_KEY environment variable.  An alternative approach is to make use of the customHeaders property within the REST API for configuring webhooks. This option offers increased flexibility when custom or multiple headers are needed.
